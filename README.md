Hi, I'm [Tway Wandiky Lumban Gaol](https://twaygaol.me/), but you can call me [Tway](https://twaygaol.me/). I'm a passionate self-taught web developer and freelance software engineer from Indonesia. My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and bringing them to life with elegant interfaces. I pay a lot of attention to the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
